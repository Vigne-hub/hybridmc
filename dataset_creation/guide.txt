These python scripts help generate the trainign set for the ML models using hybridmc.

The input files for hybridmc are generated by gendata_all.py

run.py runs the simuation for each input file

The entropy values for each simulation are computed using make_avg_diff.py

collect_data.py puts together all the data form the different simulations in one file

make_dataset.py uses this data to make the dataset to feed the ML model.
