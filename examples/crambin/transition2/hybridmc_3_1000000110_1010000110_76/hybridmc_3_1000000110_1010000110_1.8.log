 Starting convergence loop with Sbias values = 3 0.134658 recorded distances = 1000
 Recording distances since size  = 1000  req_dists = 5000
entropy of 0 is 2.94048 with count 215
entropy of 1 is 0 with count 185
Acceptable uniform test: g_val 2.25211, g_crit 2.70554, p_val 0.133432
 Will increase the number of steps in trajectory to 14 time of propagation =14 for next iteration.
  Too few distances recorded for convergence: number is now 1400
