 Starting convergence loop with Sbias values = 3 0.657965 recorded distances = 1000
 Recording distances since size  = 1000  req_dists = 5000
entropy of 0 is 2.61351 with count 253
entropy of 1 is 0 with count 147
Rejected uniform test: g_val 28.4284, g_crit 2.70554, p_val 9.72301e-08
 Will increase the number of steps in trajectory to 13 time of propagation =13 for next iteration.
  Too few distances recorded for convergence: number is now 1400
