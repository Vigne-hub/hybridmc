 Starting convergence loop with Sbias values = 3 0.067047 recorded distances = 1000
 Recording distances since size  = 1000  req_dists = 5000
entropy of 0 is 2.82251 with count 178
entropy of 1 is 0 with count 222
Rejected uniform test: g_val 4.84981, g_crit 2.70554, p_val 0.0276492
 Will increase the number of steps in trajectory to 21 time of propagation =21 for next iteration.
  Too few distances recorded for convergence: number is now 1400
