Reading in input file hybridmc_3_1000000110_1010000110_2.94.h5
 Starting convergence loop with Sbias values = 3 0.443335 recorded distances = 1000
 Recording distances since size  = 1000  req_dists = 5000
entropy of 0 is 2.66205 with count 221
entropy of 1 is 0 with count 179
Rejected uniform test: g_val 4.41814, g_crit 2.70554, p_val 0.0355588
 Will increase the number of steps in trajectory to 9 time of propagation =9 for next iteration.
  Too few distances recorded for convergence: number is now 1400
