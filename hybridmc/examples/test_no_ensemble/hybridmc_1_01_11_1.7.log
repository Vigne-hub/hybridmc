 Starting convergence loop with Sbias values = 3 0.0300966 recorded distances = 20000
 Recording distances since size  = 20000  req_dists = 50000
entropy of 0 is 3.02998 with count 424
entropy of 1 is 0 with count 376
Rejected uniform test: g_val 2.88173, g_crit 1.3233, p_val 0.0895897
 Will increase the number of steps in trajectory to 23 time of propagation =23 for next iteration.
  Too few distances recorded for convergence: number is now 36000
 In iteration 0 flip rate = 0.87625 done_flip = 0 done_g = 0 done_distances = 0 done_ensemble = 0
      ensemble size = 37  distances recorded = 36000
