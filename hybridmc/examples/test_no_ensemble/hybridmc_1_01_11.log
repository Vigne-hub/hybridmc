 Starting convergence loop with Sbias values = 3 3.69728 recorded distances = 20000
 Recording distances since size  = 20000  req_dists = 50000
entropy of 0 is -0.709783 with count 395
entropy of 1 is 0 with count 405
Acceptable uniform test: g_val 0.125003, g_crit 1.3233, p_val 0.72367
  Too few distances recorded for convergence: number is now 36000
 In iteration 0 flip rate = 20.4013 done_flip = 1 done_g = 1 done_distances = 0 done_ensemble = 0
      ensemble size = 44  distances recorded = 36000
