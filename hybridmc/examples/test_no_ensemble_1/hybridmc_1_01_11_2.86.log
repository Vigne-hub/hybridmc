 Starting convergence loop with Sbias values = 3 1.5324 recorded distances = 20000
 Recording distances since size  = 20000  req_dists = 50000
entropy of 0 is 1.53772 with count 428
entropy of 1 is 0 with count 372
Rejected uniform test: g_val 3.92321, g_crit 1.3233, p_val 0.0476239
  Too few distances recorded for convergence: number is now 36000
 In iteration 0 flip rate = 1.82875 done_flip = 1 done_g = 0 done_distances = 0 done_ensemble = 0
      ensemble size = 41  distances recorded = 36000
