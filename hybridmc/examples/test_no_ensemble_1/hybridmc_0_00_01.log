git commit 1a58d87574a3e84f6380d3fec9d82eecf7949bde-DIRTY
 Starting convergence loop with Sbias values = 3 -0.608966 recorded distances = 20000
 Recording distances since size  = 20000  req_dists = 50000
entropy of 0 is 3.61147 with count 401
entropy of 1 is 0 with count 399
Acceptable uniform test: g_val 0.00500001, g_crit 1.3233, p_val 0.943628
 Will increase the number of steps in trajectory to 32 time of propagation =32 for next iteration.
  Too few distances recorded for convergence: number is now 36000
 In iteration 0 flip rate = 0.63375 done_flip = 0 done_g = 1 done_distances = 0 done_ensemble = 0
      ensemble size = 42  distances recorded = 36000
